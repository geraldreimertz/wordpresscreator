# wordpresscreator
The final Script of my [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obDw9jONTjs) developed with the help of [GPT3](https://beta.openai.com/playground)

The script automatically creates new wordpress site, or copies an existing one on an ubuntu nginx mysql system. Additionally the SSL certification is done with certbot and nginx configured. 

Please make sure to review the script, before you use it on your system!

Run it with:
sudo bash wordpress.sh
